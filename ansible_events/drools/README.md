This module is based on original work by Jesus Ruiz
found at https://github.com/jruizgit/rules

This module has been adapted to substitute the
C library with a Python module that is redirecting
the internal procedure invocation to a custom REST service.

The REST service is implemented at https://github.com/mariofusco/drools-yaml-rules
